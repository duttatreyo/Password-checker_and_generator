This Python program serves dual purposes: it checks the strength of user-inputted passwords and generates strong, secure passwords upon user request.

## Description
The Password Strength Checker validates passwords based on several criteria, including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It also checks against common password patterns and repetitions.

## Features
Strength Checking: Validates user-inputted passwords and provides feedback on how to improve them.
Password Generation: Generates a strong, secure password using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
Regeneration Option: Allows users to regenerate passwords until they are satisfied with the result.
Interactive UI: Provides an interactive command-line interface for user interaction.

## Usage
Run the Python script in a suitable environment.
Input your password when prompted to check its strength.
Choose whether you want to generate a strong password.
Decide if you want to regenerate the provided strong password.
Continue with a new password or exit the program as needed.


Alternatively, you can download the HTML code and utilize the Checker for more streamlined tasks.

##Example
```$ python password-checker.py```

Example Output
Enter the password: example
Password must be at least 12 characters long.
Would you like to generate a strong password? (yes/no): yes
Generated Password: Kz4^vP1&xH7!wL2z
Would you like to regenerate the password? (yes/no): no
Would you like to try again with a new password? (yes/no): no
Exiting the program.
